# Plot Config

The Plot Configuration tab, where you get to customize the look of your plot. Most of these are self explanatory - add a title, add gridlines and change their opacity.

You can change the font size of the X-axis tick strings. You can change the refresh interval of the plot in live data mode, although this does not change the rate at which live data streams in, which varies among PVs.
